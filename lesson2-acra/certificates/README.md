# Certificates generation and storage for our services.

This folder contains script to generate certificates and sample certificates (which would be overwriten once you run `certgen`).

## Contents

- `certgen.sh`: Shell script which would call `openssl` and generate all the required certificates, saving them in `data` subfolder, overwriting the existing ones.
- `data`: Folder where certificates, generated by `certgen.sh`, would be stored. Contains the following sample files:
  - `ca.crt, ca.key, ca.srl`: certificate authority certificate, private key, and serial number.
  - `acra-client.crt, acra-client.key`: certificate and private key for acra client.
  - `acra-server.crt, acra-server.key` : certificate and private key for acra server.
  - `mysql.crt, mysql.key` : certificate and private key for the mysql server.
